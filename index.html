    <h3> Welcome to my website!! I'm Mikaela-Rose but you can just call me Mikaela, i'm 16 years old and a rising high school junior (I go to Sprayberry High School in Marietta,Ga). Some hobbies of mine outside of coding are drawing, playing my violin, and playing basketball. Specifically, I really enjoy art though I love expressing myself in one of the best ways I know how. A old sketch of mine can be viewed on the portfolio page. </h3>
